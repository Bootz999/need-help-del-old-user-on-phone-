#need-help-del-old-user-on-phone?!?!?
Really starting to piss me off!!!! Ive been
Watching videos on YouTube to try and help 
To all my knowledge which is very little in 
Coding ive 
1- got pass the setup wizard
2- disabled all setups pkgs 
But the phone is not fully unlocked I can't
Use play store not a big deal except all my
Games sign up with Google ðŸ˜­(COD-mobile)ext.ext.
So that sucks also can't hit the builder number
A bunch of times to unlock developer mode
Which you have to do to flash the phone so 
I'm kinda in a pickle ðŸ¥’ and have wasted 
Countless hrs and days trying to figure out how 
Downloading and undownloading pkgs
On terminal (like yep this one sounds good)
But that's only made me the best pkgs downloader
In NYC, but little to help me 
To wipe the old user off the phone ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ’¯ 
Please help!!!!!! Thanks
